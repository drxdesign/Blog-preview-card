## My process
At first I had to create the full html base. after that I started making the style. using tailwind css. But for some reason I had to use simple CSS component or let's say custom css because you have to use the same colour that they give you for the challenge and the same font.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Things that I've learned from this project is that I'm trying to master tailwind css because it's light, it's beautiful and it's easy to use Initially on a big scale apps. so I'm trying to master this for. bigger project.

### Continued development

So. what I'm going to try to focus next is making this same design, but using astrobuild and tailwind css and hopefully I can add a light and dark. theme I want to make it interactive so it can take you to another pages for a real blog.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS.](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I'm not gonna lie in some parts, especially when it comes to text and other stuff like that. I had to check the tailwind documentation. It truly helped me.
